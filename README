                              QINGY
												Qingy Is Not GettY


/----------------\
| What is qingy? |
\----------------/
qingy is a replacement of getty.
Written in C, it uses DirectFB to provide a fast, nice GUI
without the overhead of the X Windows System.
It allows the user to log in and start the session of his choice
(text console, gnome, kde, wmaker, ...).


/----------------\
|    Features    |
\----------------/
- It works ;-)
- It remembers last user who logged in, with focus on password
- It also rememebers last session each user chose
- Fully themable
- Has support for shadow passwords
- Has support for PAM
- You can start more that one X session at once
- You can even start X inside a console when X sessions
  are already running


/----------------\
|     Usage      |
\----------------/
- Use <TAB> to jump to the next section
- Use <SHIFT-TAB> to jump to the previous section
- You can also use your mouse and click a section
- Type as you always did in previous life ;-) (*)
- Use <UP> and <DOWN> arrows to browse sessions
- Click on <POWER> and <RESET> buttons and you will,
  respectively, poweroff and reboot
- The above can also be obtained via <ALT-P> and <ALT-R>
- Press <ENTER> to log in
- Press <ESC> two times to deactivate DirectFB and get a text login
- Press <ALT-Fn> (or <CTRL-ALT-Fn>) to switch to the nth tty(**)
- If you log into, say, WindowMaker, and then change VT,
  WM will wait for you to switch back to the previous VT

(*) you can use all the usual <LEFT>, <RIGHT>, <HOME>,
    <END>, <DEL>, <BACKSPACE> keys to edit your text
(**) there is no need to enable VT switching in DirectFDB


/----------------\
|Program Options |
\----------------/
Output of 'qingy -h':

qingy version 0.1

Usage: qingy <ttyname> [options]
Options:
   -black-screen-workaround
    Try this if you get a black screen instead of a text console.
    Note: switching to another vt and back also solves the problem.


/----------------\
| Configuration  |
