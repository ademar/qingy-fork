 			Qingy Is Not GettY


PLEASE NOTE: You should read the documentation for more/newer
	     details. This file might be updated slightly less
	     frequently than the info files.

Just like nearly every other linux program ;-)
- Unpack tarball and cd to dir
- ./configure
- make
- make install


/---------------\
|    Set up     |
\---------------/
You have to modify your /etc/inittab file.
You should find in it a section that goes like this:

# TERMINALS
c1:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty1 linux
c2:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty2 linux
c3:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty3 linux
c4:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty4 linux
c5:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty5 linux
c6:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty6 linux

and modify it as follows:

# TERMINALS
c1:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty1
c2:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty2
c3:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty3
c4:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty4
c5:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty5
c6:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty6 linux

After that you can either reboot your system or use
the following commands (as root):
init Q
killall <agetty>
where <agetty> is the name of your previous *getty.
After this, either logout or change terminal to see
qingy in all it's glory!

I suggest you leave at least one terminal with your old *getty,
so that in case of problems or misconfiguration
(remember that qingy is beta software, so there may well be
some bugs) you have at least one surely working terminal.

|      GO!      |

Yes, now you are ready to go ;-)
