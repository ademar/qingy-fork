                              QINGY
												Qingy Is Not GettY


/---------------\

Just like nearly every other linux program ;-)
- Unpack tarball and cd to dir
- ./configure
- make
- make install

In order to use qingy you have to properly
configure DirectFB for your console framebuffer:
run 'fbset' and paste the output as the first entry
in /etc/fb.modes. Qingy should auto create a file
named /etc/directfbrc.qingy with this line in it:
mode=1024x768
If for some reason you don't have such file or it
does contain the wrong stuff, please correct it
manually.
Change 1024x768 with the actual resolution of
your console framebuffer. This should have you
up and running with DirectFB.

You also have to modify your /etc/inittab file.
You should find in it a section that goes like this:

# TERMINALS
c1:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty1 linux
c2:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty2 linux
c3:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty3 linux
c4:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty4 linux
c5:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty5 linux
c6:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty6 linux

and modify it as follows:

# TERMINALS
c1:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty1
c2:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty2
c3:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty3
c4:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty4
c5:12345:respawn:/sbin/qingy tty5
c6:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty6 linux

After that you can either reboot your system or use
the following commands (as root):
init Q
killall <agetty>
where <agetty> is the name of your previous *getty.
After this, either logout or change terminal to see
qingy in all it's glory!

I suggest you leave at least one terminal with your old *getty,
so that in case of problems or misconfiguration
(remember that qingy is beta software, so there may well be
some bugs) you have at least one surely working terminal.

Yes, now you are ready to go ;-)
