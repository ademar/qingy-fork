qingy CVS:
- Unlock vt switching before dying (yes, this was annoying)
- Solved a bug that made qingy crash when you switched to its
  tty after some time it had been sitting there. Basically
  it opened a file descriptor every second and did not close
  it...
- Now qingy reverts to text mode instead of dying when it
  encounters non-fatal errors in command line parameters or
  settings / theme file...
- Various previously unchecked allocations got leashed
- Fixes and clean ups

qingy 0.2.3 (21 October 2003):
- Now qingy locks vt switching when it enters DirectFB mode.
  So it no longer crashes when you switch VT while it is starting
- no longer necessary to use a seed file to select a random theme
  (you can safely remove file /etc/qingy/seed if it exists)
- Added support for text mode sessions
  (just add your session script in /etc/qingy/sessions)
- Moved themes directory to /etc/qingy/themes
  (note that you do not need to change your /etc/qingy/settings)
- Added some code to allow restarting of gpm even if it was
  stopped by a previous session of qingy (that crashed ;-P)
- Removed '--silent' option. Now qingy is silent by default.
  If you still want to get diagnostic messages on stderr
  you have to use the '--verbose' option
- Added photo screen saver (it displays a slide show of photos)
- Added option 'SCREEN_SAVER' to config file. You can specify
  'pixel' or 'photo' to select which screen saver you want
- Added option 'IMAGES_PATH' to config file. Use it to specify 
  a directory containing images to use with photo screen saver.
  Note: you can specify more than one path by putting
  several 'IMAGES_PATH' lines into the config file.
- No longer necessary to start qingy in the first 12 ttys
- Added support for comments is config file.
- A surprise now awaits the rightful master ;-)	
- The usual minor fixes and clean ups
	
qingy 0.2.2 (29 September 2003):
- Starting X sessions for users with a shell other than bash
  should no longer fail with strange errors
  (this occurred at least with tcsh)
- added support for selecting a random theme
  at startup (just use 'random' as theme name)
- added support for screen savers
- added a screen saver: pixel
- added option to select which framebuffer device to use
- updated text mode login for increased security
- no longer necessary to create a /etc/directfbrc file:
  now qingy creates automatically file /etc/directfbrc.qingy
  (thus other DirectFB apps are unaffected) with
  hopefully the proper resolution already detected.
  Note: you need the 'fbset' program for this.

qingy 0.2.1 (01 September 2003):
- correctly changes tty ownership
- Hopefully solves PAM issues
- Added option to close DirectFB mode before shutting down,
  so that you can see your system shutdown messages
- Added option for hiding last user name
- Added option for hiding password chars completely
- Now ENTER in username field pass control to password
- Now qingy reverts back to text mode login if something
  goes wrong with DirectFB
- Message "Login failed" now appears for 2 seconds
- Various fixes and clean ups (memory leaks, allocation failures...)

qingy 0.2 (18 July 2003):
- Added PAM support
- Added --silent option to avoid diagnostic messages on stderr
- Various clean ups

qingy 0.1.1 (09 July 2003):
