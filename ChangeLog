qingy CVS:
- Now qingy locks vt switching when it enters DirectFB mode.
  So it no longer crashes when you switch VT while it is starting
- no longer necessary to use a seed file to select a random theme
  (you can safely remove file /etc/qingy/seed if it exists)

qingy 0.2.2 (29 September 2003):
- Starting X sessions for users with a shell other than bash
  should no longer fail with strange errors
  (this occurred at least with tcsh)
- added support for selecting a random theme
  at startup (just use 'random' as theme name)
- added support for screen savers
- added a screen saver: pixel
- added option to select which framebuffer device to use
- updated text mode login for increased security
- no longer necessary to create a /etc/directfbrc file:
  now qingy creates automatically file /etc/directfbrc.qingy
  (thus other DirectFB apps are unaffected) with
  hopefully the proper resolution already detected.
  Note: you need the 'fbset' program for this.

qingy 0.2.1 (01 September 2003):
- correctly changes tty ownership
- Hopefully solves PAM issues
- Added option to close DirectFB mode before shutting down,
  so that you can see your system shutdown messages
- Added option for hiding last user name
- Added option for hiding password chars completely
- Now ENTER in username field pass control to password
- Now qingy reverts back to text mode login if something
  goes wrong with DirectFB
- Message "Login failed" now appears for 2 seconds
- Various fixes and clean ups (memory leaks, allocation failures...)
