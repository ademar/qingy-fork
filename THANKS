- Davide Scola <davide.gnu@disi.unige.it> who taught me
  how to teach myself how to program in C
- Per Liden and <largo@windowmaker.org> for his "Login.app"
  (http://largo.windowmaker.org/Login.app/)
  This is where I got the idea for this app. And some graphics elements, too.
- All the guys that gave light to DirectFB
  (http://www.directfb.org)
  Great work!

  light, amongst other things, to the great
  config file parser we now have
- Brian Carter <spakov@users.sourceforge.net>
  who provided code to select a session by typing the first char
  of its name.
