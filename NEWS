qingy CVS:
- New command line argument: '--resolution <xres>x<yres>'.
  Use it if qingy fails to properly detect your framebuffer
  resolution.
- Added support for choosing your favourite X server in settings file
- Fixed theme loading code, now qingy should not crash any more...
- Made sure that if qingy dies horribly during initialization,
  it does it with tty switching enabled so that user is not
  stuck in front of a 'respawning too fast' message...
- Allow for buttons with no action associated to them,
  just use "action = NULL", thanks to a suggestion from
  Dark Liquid (http://www.darkliquid.net/)


qingy 0.4.0 (18 March 2004):
- Properly detect framebuffer resolution on qingy startup,
  instead of using directfbrc.qingy, which is no longer necessary:
  you can safely remove it from your system. This also means that
  you no longer need to have the 'fbset' utility to compile qingy.
- Now screensavers are modular; this means that:
  - only the screensaver you chose gets loaded at run time; this
    makes qingy use a little less memory
  - you can roll your own screensaver, without need to recompile qingy
  - you must be careful about the screensaver you install, this
    is effectively an entry point to arbitrary code that would
    run with root privileges (don't say you haven't been warned ;-P )
- Pa0lino added an utility, 'themer', to convert qingy 0.2 series
  theme files to qingy 0.3 theme structure...
- Fixed some bugs in config files parser...
- Added support for writing to /var/log/wtmp; this allows tools
  like 'who', 'w', 'finger' to be able to 'see' users logged
  in with qingy.
- Added option in both setting and theme file to select wether you
  want or not to clear the background image in dialogs like
  "logging in user...".
- Added support for tty specific options. See the new settings file
  for an example on how this works.
- Added a file, /etc/qingy/welcomes, where you can put personalized
  welcome messages (like the 'Greetings, Master...' when you log in
  as root).
- Added session locking support; if you enable this, when you try to
  switch to a qingy-controlled tty whose owner is not your current
  user, you will be asked for the password of that user before being
  allowed to continue. If you are root, of course, you can switch
  to any tty you chose to. Default setting is 'no'. Note: this is
	an EXPERIMENTAL feature, so you are warned. That said, it appears
  to work well, only issue that I know of is that if you log in into
  a text console and later fire up an X server manually, the tty the
  X server is running in is not guarded.
- Made qingy install its stuff in a way that conforms to the file
  system hierarchy standards (themes are now installed to
  /usr/share/qingy/themes, screen savers to
  /usr/lib/qingy/screensavers).
- Now qingy by default creates a bunch of shared libraries and loads
  its stuff only when it is needed. This saves a lot of memory,
  expecially for those qingy processes that are waiting for someone
  to switch to the tty they are running in. This option can be
  disabled with by passing the '--enable-static-build' argument
  to ./configure
- Be nicer to Slackware (and maybe other distros as well ;-)
  This means:
  - qingy now sets also the PATH env variable (otherwise qingy is
    not able to start an X session because xinit is not able to
    find the location of the X server; this is true for Slackware).
  - Slackware puts its X session scripts in /etc/X11/xinit/
    now we honour that, too, following their name pattern "xinitrc.*"
- Screen saver support is now optional (but enabled by default), for
  those security paranoids ;-P


qingy 0.3.0 (09 January 2004):
- New memory allocation/deallocation management
- Unlock vt switching before dying (yes, this was annoying)
- Solved a bug that made qingy crash when you switched to its
  tty after it had been sitting there for some time. Basically
  it opened a file descriptor every second and did not close
  it...
- Now qingy reverts to text mode instead of dying when it
  encounters non-fatal errors in command line parameters or
  settings / theme file...
- Various previously unchecked memory allocations got leashed
- Now qingy parses /etc/inittab to decide what to do when
  user presses ctrl-alt-del (up to now it did nothing).
  Supported stuff: poweroff, halt, reboot, shutdown
  (with -h or -r), as well as just displaying a message
  (echo "your message here").
- Added --disable-lastuser option to tell qingy not do display
  last user name. This way it will always ask for user name.
- Added support for user's own .xsession file (just create a
  .xsession file in your home dir, put there the stuff you
  want to load, and choose "Your .xsession" as session).
- Now background image stays there when attempting to log in,
  during timeouts... It goes away only during screen saver
- Added ./configure option to disable PAM support (--disable-pam)
- Added support in config file to specify a shutdown policy:
  use 'shutdown_policy = everyone' to allow everyone to shutdown
      'shutdown_policy = root' to be asked for root password
      'shutdown_policy = noone' to forbid shutdown completely.
  If this option is not used, qingy defaults to 'everyone'
- Rewrote load_settings.c (and added others ;-P). Now parsing
  of setting and theme files is done via regular expressions.
  I undestand little (but I will ;-P) of that stuff, so all
  the praise goes to Paolino <paolino.gnu@disi.unige.it>...
- Radically changed configuration files structure... too hard
  to explain it all here: see updated documentation for all
  details. In short: all stuff you see on screen can be
  added, removed, moved, changed... you got the point :-)
- Added user-oriented welcome messages. See documentation.
  Thanks, again, to Paolino <paolino.gnu@disi.unige.it>
- Added support for user-provided CFLAGS: just use
  ./configure MY_CFLAGS="your_cflags_here"
  Please note that qingy already tries to set the best
  optimization for your arch in CFLAGS; using the above
  feature overrides those settings... I added this feature
  primarily to use with Gentoo GNU Linux portage system.
- Added info documentation for qingy, thanks (again) to
  Pa0lino... just issue a 'info qingy'!
- Many fixes and clean ups


qingy 0.2.3 (21 October 2003):
- Now qingy locks vt switching when it enters DirectFB mode.
  So it no longer crashes when you switch VT while it is starting
- no longer necessary to use a seed file to select a random theme
  (you can safely remove file /etc/qingy/seed if it exists)
- Added support for text mode sessions
  (just add your session script in /etc/qingy/sessions)
- Moved themes directory to /etc/qingy/themes
  (note that you do not need to change your /etc/qingy/settings)
- Added some code to allow restarting of gpm even if it was
  stopped by a previous session of qingy (that crashed ;-P)
- Removed '--silent' option. Now qingy is silent by default.
  If you still want to get diagnostic messages on stderr
  you have to use the '--verbose' option
- Added photo screen saver (it displays a slide show of photos)
- Added option 'SCREEN_SAVER' to config file. You can specify
  'pixel' or 'photo' to select which screen saver you want
- Added option 'IMAGES_PATH' to config file. Use it to specify 
  a directory containing images to use with photo screen saver.
  Note: you can specify more than one path by putting
  several 'IMAGES_PATH' lines into the config file.
- No longer necessary to start qingy in the first 12 ttys
- Added support for comments is config file.
- A surprise now awaits the rightful master ;-)	
- The usual minor fixes and clean ups


qingy 0.2.2 (29 September 2003):
- Starting X sessions for users with a shell other than bash
  should no longer fail with strange errors
  (this occurred at least with tcsh)
- added support for selecting a random theme
  at startup (just use 'random' as theme name)
- added support for screen savers
- added a screen saver: pixel
- added option to select which framebuffer device to use
- updated text mode login for increased security
- no longer necessary to create a /etc/directfbrc file:
  now qingy creates automatically file /etc/directfbrc.qingy
  (thus other DirectFB apps are unaffected) with
  hopefully the proper resolution already detected.
  Note: you need the 'fbset' program for this.


qingy 0.2.1 (01 September 2003):
- correctly changes tty ownership
- Hopefully solves PAM issues
- Added option to close DirectFB mode before shutting down,
  so that you can see your system shutdown messages
- Added option for hiding last user name
- Added option for hiding password chars completely
- Now ENTER in username field pass control to password
- Now qingy reverts back to text mode login if something
  goes wrong with DirectFB
- Message "Login failed" now appears for 2 seconds
- Various fixes and clean ups (memory leaks, allocation failures...)


qingy 0.2 (18 July 2003):
- Added PAM support
- Added --silent option to avoid diagnostic messages on stderr
- Various clean ups


qingy 0.1.1 (09 July 2003):
- embedded object related functions into object structures themselves
- full theme support
- Changed default theme to the Ant one
- Various clean ups


qingy 0.1 (05 July 2003):
