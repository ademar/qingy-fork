qingy CVS-0.6.1-CVS:
- SECURITY ENHANCEMENT: made qingy GUI communicate auth data
  to its main process using a fifo instead of an actual file.
- Added support for Fedora Core Linux. This means that I added some magic
  to detect wether Gnome or Kde (or both of course) are installed, so that
  qingy can display them in the sessions list...
- Manage text mode logins internally, without calling 'login'.
  In this case, /etc/issue will be parsed and its contents
  displayed on screen before login prompt.
- Added '-t' command line argument that tells qingy to
  perform a text mode login (no graphics). This will allow users
  to log in using an old-fashioned getty-like mode, but still retain
  qingy advanced features like autologin and session locking.
- Added support for calling a script just before qingy GUI is fired up,
  and one after it is shut down. Useful if DirectFB is picky about your
  machine and you need to do something before/after switching DirectFB
  mode on/off.
- Moved GPM start/stop code to external scripts that are called via
  the feature described above. Currently supported distros are Gentoo
  and Fedora.
- Made X start up in the same tty we logged in instead of switching
  to a new one.
- Made qingy check authentication data only once, in its main
  process. Until now it was once in the GUI and once in the
  main process, leading to potential problems with /etc/securetty
  since the GUI does not live in the same tty as the main process.
- Added support for selecting last session on a per-user or a
  per-tty basis. Previous (and current default) behaviour was
  per-user only. To change it you have to set variable
  last_session_policy in settings file.
- Added support to select wether qingy should calculate last user
  on a global or a per-tty basis. Default will be current
  functionality, i.e. global. To change it you have to set variable
  last_user_policy in settings file.
- Added new settings file variable, x_server_offset.
  This is the offset used to search for an available X server number.
  This number will affect the DISPLAY env variable. 
  Default is 1, setting it to 0 will make buggy OpenGL implementations
  (like the ATI one) work with qingy (read: 3D support), but it will also
  make impossible to start an X server from console using startx without
  passing it extra parameters.
- Added support for Mobile Pentium 4 processors optimization.
- Added EXPERIMENTAL support for GNU libgcrypt as crypto library.
  If you decide to try it out, good luck creating a good keypair!
- Other small enhancements and bug fixes.

qingy 0.6.0 (30 May 2005):
- SECURITY ENHANCEMENT: added support for encrypting communications
  between qingy and its user interface, triggered by new ./configure
  option: --enable-crypto, enabled by default.
- SECURITY ENHANCEMENT: Overwrite memory areas containing sensitive
  user info before quitting...
- SECURITY FIX: now authentication data is passed between
  qingy and its GUI trough a securely created temp file.
- A drop-down mouse menu for sessions has been implemented.
- Added customizable keybindings support
- Because of the above, removed old powerkeys support
- Fixed a rather obscure bug in which login could fail
  even if username and password were correct
- Added new setting in theme file, 'native_resolution', which
  lets you specify the screen resolution the theme was crafted
  for. This way, when qingy encounters a resolution different
  than this one, it will scale all graphic elements so that
  they look the same on all resolutions.
- Added two new font sizes that can be used in theme files:
  'smaller' and 'tiny'.
- Updated handling of utmp/wtmp logging so that chrootkit no longer
  finds deletions in the latter when user logs out.
- Brought tty guardian to a nearly completed state: now it
  checks the tty you came from; if you were logged in as root
  or as same user on the destination tty, it lets you pass,
  otherwise it will ask you to enter either destination user
  or root password. If authentication fails, it will send you
  back to the tty you came from. It also remembers the last
  user who successfully authenticated, so that he will not
  have to authenticate again every time he switches to the
  guarded tty (but if you switch to a tty owned by a third
  user and go back, authentication will be asked again). The
  only drawback is that if you come from an X session in which
  you are logged in as root, it will ask you to authenticate,
  because that situation can not (yet) be distinguished from
  when you come from an unused tty (which is owned by root
  as well)...
- Fixed a number of tty guardian related bugs.
- Other small fixes and clean-ups.


qingy 0.5.3 (11 January 2005):
- Finally the code behind the 'sleep' button has been implemented:
  just set up the 'sleep' variable in config file to the
  command you would like to execute for sleep mode, and
  press the button in qingy...
- Now the directory qingy uses to store its temporary files
  can be customized
- Added support for automatically logging in a user when
  the machine powers up
- Correctly unset the DISPLAY env variable when starting a text
  mode session, in case PAM provided one to us anyway.
- Added support for passing user-defined arguments to the X server.
  To enhance security, as a default we now pass '-nolisten tcp'...
- Added support for AMD Athlon64 processors optimization.
- Fixed support for shadow password authentication...
- Fix stuff so that qingy links correctly against the PAM
  library when compiled as a static binary.
- Session files containing spaces are now supported
- Reworked qingy PAM module to make it work with more distros
  (tested on Fedora, Debian, Gentoo)
- Added support for 'retries' setting in config file
  which allows user to specify how many times qingy
  should try to bring its gui up before reverting
  to text mode...


qingy 0.5.2 (19 Aug 2004):
- Brown paper bag release: fix horrible bug I just introduced not allowing
  to run qingy any more due to incorrect cmd line arguments handling...


qingy 0.5.1 (18 Aug 2004):
- Fixed a bug that prevented qingy from honouring
  tty specific options in config file.
- Fixed a bug that prevented qingy from honouring some
  command line arguments...
- Fix X11 sessions search path for Gentoo linux.
- Code clean ups.


qingy 0.5.0 (17 Aug 2004):
- This new major version finally is able to work-around all issues
  between DirectFB and 2.6 kernels. But make sure to use a kernel 
  >= 2.6.8 and never, ever attempt a 2.6.7 one as it is likely to
	lock up your machine completely. You have been warned ;-)
- High memory usage issues are now solved, now qingy should use
  ~2.5 MB of RAM when user is logged in (instead of ~40MB!)...
- Remove support for the '--black-screen-workaround'
	cmd line arg, as it is no longer needed.


qingy 0.4.1 (28 Jul 2004):
- Added proper support for transparent pixmaps, now qingy
  will honour the transparency instead of faking it by
  making the black pixels transparent...
- New command line argument: '--resolution <xres>x<yres>'.
  Use it if qingy fails to properly detect your framebuffer
  resolution.
- Added support for choosing your favourite X server in settings file
- Fixed theme loading code, now qingy should not crash any more...
- Made sure that if qingy dies horribly during initialization,
  it does it with tty switching enabled so that user is not
  stuck in front of a 'respawning too fast' message...
- Allow for buttons with no action associated to them,
  just use "action = NULL", thanks to a suggestion from
  Dark Liquid (http://www.darkliquid.net/)
- Moved last user file from /etc/qingy/ to /var/lib/misc/
  to comply to the File System Hierarchy Standard.
  Thanks to Jason Andryuk <the_deuce@yahoo.com>
  for poinint this out.
- Accepted a patch from Konstantin Korikov <lostclus@ukr.net>
  that adds new keybindings in text boxes:
  ctrl-h: delete one character
  ctrl-u: delete all characters
  ctrl-j: go to next textbox (same as ENTER)


qingy 0.4.0 (18 March 2004):
- Properly detect framebuffer resolution on qingy startup,
  instead of using directfbrc.qingy, which is no longer necessary:
  you can safely remove it from your system. This also means that
  you no longer need to have the 'fbset' utility to compile qingy.
- Now screensavers are modular; this means that:
  - only the screensaver you chose gets loaded at run time; this
    makes qingy use a little less memory
  - you can roll your own screensaver, without need to recompile qingy
  - you must be careful about the screensaver you install, this
    is effectively an entry point to arbitrary code that would
    run with root privileges (don't say you haven't been warned ;-P )
- Pa0lino added an utility, 'themer', to convert qingy 0.2 series
  theme files to qingy 0.3 theme structure...
- Fixed some bugs in config files parser...
- Added support for writing to /var/log/wtmp; this allows tools
  like 'who', 'w', 'finger' to be able to 'see' users logged
  in with qingy.
- Added option in both setting and theme file to select wether you
  want or not to clear the background image in dialogs like
  "logging in user...".
- Added support for tty specific options. See the new settings file
  for an example on how this works.
- Added a file, /etc/qingy/welcomes, where you can put personalized
  welcome messages (like the 'Greetings, Master...' when you log in
  as root).
- Added session locking support; if you enable this, when you try to
  switch to a qingy-controlled tty whose owner is not your current
  user, you will be asked for the password of that user before being
  allowed to continue. If you are root, of course, you can switch
  to any tty you chose to. Default setting is 'no'. Note: this is
	an EXPERIMENTAL feature, so you are warned. That said, it appears
  to work well, only issue that I know of is that if you log in into
  a text console and later fire up an X server manually, the tty the
  X server is running in is not guarded.
- Made qingy install its stuff in a way that conforms to the file
  system hierarchy standards (themes are now installed to
  /usr/share/qingy/themes, screen savers to
  /usr/lib/qingy/screensavers).
- Now qingy by default creates a bunch of shared libraries and loads
  its stuff only when it is needed. This saves a lot of memory,
  expecially for those qingy processes that are waiting for someone
  to switch to the tty they are running in. This option can be
  disabled with by passing the '--enable-static-build' argument
  to ./configure
- Be nicer to Slackware (and maybe other distros as well ;-)
  This means:
  - qingy now sets also the PATH env variable (otherwise qingy is
    not able to start an X session because xinit is not able to
    find the location of the X server; this is true for Slackware).
  - Slackware puts its X session scripts in /etc/X11/xinit/
    now we honour that, too, following their name pattern "xinitrc.*"
- Screen saver support is now optional (but enabled by default), for
  those security paranoids ;-P


qingy 0.3.0 (09 January 2004):
- New memory allocation/deallocation management
- Unlock vt switching before dying (yes, this was annoying)
- Solved a bug that made qingy crash when you switched to its
  tty after it had been sitting there for some time. Basically
  it opened a file descriptor every second and did not close
  it...
- Now qingy reverts to text mode instead of dying when it
  encounters non-fatal errors in command line parameters or
  settings / theme file...
- Various previously unchecked memory allocations got leashed
- Now qingy parses /etc/inittab to decide what to do when
  user presses ctrl-alt-del (up to now it did nothing).
  Supported stuff: poweroff, halt, reboot, shutdown
  (with -h or -r), as well as just displaying a message
  (echo "your message here").
- Added --disable-lastuser option to tell qingy not do display
  last user name. This way it will always ask for user name.
- Added support for user's own .xsession file (just create a
  .xsession file in your home dir, put there the stuff you
  want to load, and choose "Your .xsession" as session).
- Now background image stays there when attempting to log in,
  during timeouts... It goes away only during screen saver
- Added ./configure option to disable PAM support (--disable-pam)
- Added support in config file to specify a shutdown policy:
  use 'shutdown_policy = everyone' to allow everyone to shutdown
      'shutdown_policy = root' to be asked for root password
      'shutdown_policy = noone' to forbid shutdown completely.
  If this option is not used, qingy defaults to 'everyone'
- Rewrote load_settings.c (and added others ;-P). Now parsing
  of setting and theme files is done via regular expressions.
  I undestand little (but I will ;-P) of that stuff, so all
  the praise goes to Paolino <paolino.gnu@disi.unige.it>...
- Radically changed configuration files structure... too hard
  to explain it all here: see updated documentation for all
  details. In short: all stuff you see on screen can be
  added, removed, moved, changed... you got the point :-)
- Added user-oriented welcome messages. See documentation.
  Thanks, again, to Paolino <paolino.gnu@disi.unige.it>
- Added support for user-provided CFLAGS: just use
  ./configure MY_CFLAGS="your_cflags_here"
  Please note that qingy already tries to set the best
  optimization for your arch in CFLAGS; using the above
  feature overrides those settings... I added this feature
  primarily to use with Gentoo GNU Linux portage system.
- Added info documentation for qingy, thanks (again) to
  Pa0lino... just issue a 'info qingy'!
- Many fixes and clean ups


qingy 0.2.3 (21 October 2003):
- Now qingy locks vt switching when it enters DirectFB mode.
  So it no longer crashes when you switch VT while it is starting
- no longer necessary to use a seed file to select a random theme
  (you can safely remove file /etc/qingy/seed if it exists)
- Added support for text mode sessions
  (just add your session script in /etc/qingy/sessions)
- Moved themes directory to /etc/qingy/themes
  (note that you do not need to change your /etc/qingy/settings)
- Added some code to allow restarting of gpm even if it was
  stopped by a previous session of qingy (that crashed ;-P)
- Removed '--silent' option. Now qingy is silent by default.
  If you still want to get diagnostic messages on stderr
  you have to use the '--verbose' option
- Added photo screen saver (it displays a slide show of photos)
- Added option 'SCREEN_SAVER' to config file. You can specify
  'pixel' or 'photo' to select which screen saver you want
- Added option 'IMAGES_PATH' to config file. Use it to specify 
  a directory containing images to use with photo screen saver.
  Note: you can specify more than one path by putting
  several 'IMAGES_PATH' lines into the config file.
- No longer necessary to start qingy in the first 12 ttys
- Added support for comments is config file.
- A surprise now awaits the rightful master ;-)	
- The usual minor fixes and clean ups


qingy 0.2.2 (29 September 2003):
- Starting X sessions for users with a shell other than bash
  should no longer fail with strange errors
  (this occurred at least with tcsh)
- added support for selecting a random theme
  at startup (just use 'random' as theme name)
- added support for screen savers
- added a screen saver: pixel
- added option to select which framebuffer device to use
- updated text mode login for increased security
- no longer necessary to create a /etc/directfbrc file:
  now qingy creates automatically file /etc/directfbrc.qingy
  (thus other DirectFB apps are unaffected) with
  hopefully the proper resolution already detected.
  Note: you need the 'fbset' program for this.


qingy 0.2.1 (01 September 2003):
- correctly changes tty ownership
- Hopefully solves PAM issues
- Added option to close DirectFB mode before shutting down,
  so that you can see your system shutdown messages
- Added option for hiding last user name
- Added option for hiding password chars completely
- Now ENTER in username field pass control to password
- Now qingy reverts back to text mode login if something
  goes wrong with DirectFB
- Message "Login failed" now appears for 2 seconds
- Various fixes and clean ups (memory leaks, allocation failures...)


qingy 0.2 (18 July 2003):
- Added PAM support
- Added --silent option to avoid diagnostic messages on stderr
- Various clean ups


qingy 0.1.1 (09 July 2003):
- embedded object related functions into object structures themselves
- full theme support
- Changed default theme to the Ant one
- Various clean ups


qingy 0.1 (05 July 2003):
- first public release
