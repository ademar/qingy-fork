- option for selecting session based on tty, not on user

- drop down menu for sessions 

- ldap support for authentication (with pam?)

- allow selection of alternate x server layouts / X config files

- Add an option to pass parameters to X server 

* Make key bindings customizable, add more actions available to keyboard
  shortcuts, like switch to the right workspace, or to the left, ot
  to the previous one...

* Make buttons use own pixmaps alpha channel for transparency instead of
  black...

- Make applets possible... A mix of shared modules and window managing :P
  Maybe we could even port wmaker dockapps... just a dream of mine ;-)

- Make it possible to use e.g. mng files for animated images, for example for
  background and the like.

* Make code compliant to the GNU Coding Standards.. That is to be done in order
  to try inclusion in the GNU Project.

- Add support for handling console bootsplash from inside qingy? That is: qingy
  background becomes framebuffer background when you log in...

- Implement the function behind the 'sleep' button (note: we should wait
  until my own powerd is done, so that we can tell it to activate sleep mode;
  I see no point in coding the same function twice).

- Some command line options should migrate to config file...

- Add support for wildcards in paths in config files...

* Check agetty source code and see wether there is some code there to
  handle console keymaps that we should support as well...
	NOTE: it appears there is no such code: still digging.

- test in on Mandrake (8.2) and SuSe as people reported issues...

- make images scale according to virtualized / real resolution
  instead of always rendering them their actual size...

- support some graphics toolkits other than DirectFB

- $$$ (huge but interesting blurb)

- Add support for asking for a password after a given idle timeout.
  (note: look at 'who' source code to see how it gets idle times)

- Add some sort of autologin support:
  - you boot your machine, qingy autologins
    lastuser,lastsession (or user/session specified
    via config file)
  - when you exit from this session, qingy appears
    with its normal behaviour.
  But configurable ;-P

- Name theme tarball a bit better

- Add an option in theme file to select wether
  background image should be centered, scaled or tiled...

- Add support for multiline text labels...

- make the GPM start/stop stuff work for distros other
  than Gentoo, too...

- extend the --verbose option to virtually report all that can be reported ;-)

- someone reported that user gets increased when logging in, but not
  decreased when logging out!

$$$
when i log in as myself (non-root) with qingy, xinit seems to be run as root,
meaning that the system xinitrc file is used (eg. for XFCE /etc/xfce/xinitrc)
rather than the user xinitrc (eg. $HOME/.xfce4/xinitrc). i noticed this because
i use XFCE4 and changes to my xinitrc file were ignored by qingy but not when
starting xfce4 from console, instead qingy uses the /etc/ version, which is used
if $HOME/.xfce4/xinitrc can't be found (which implies that $HOME is not being
found under qingy) i know i can get round this by using the 'Your xsession'
option for logging in, but that means i have to manually set the window manager
etc in the .xsession file and cannot choose to use another one (i also use fluxbox)
via qingy if i want my $HOME session files to be used am i right in thinking that
qingy is executing xinit as root, and if so is this a bug or a feature?
how can i get qingy to use the logged-in-user's env for executing xinit etc?
