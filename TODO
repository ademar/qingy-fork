[FIXES]


-->ALLOW FOR SMALLER FONTS!!


- Some command line options should migrate to config file...

* Name theme tarball a bit better
  (BETTER YET, MOVE EVERYTHING TO FRESHMEAT AND WIPE IT OUT!)

* make the GPM start/stop stuff work for distros other
  than Gentoo, too...
  BETTER YET, wipe it out completely, since DirectFB 0.9.21 finally supports it!
  (Does it? Doesn't work here :-/ )

- extend the --verbose option to virtually report all that can be reported ;-)

* someone reported that user gets increased when logging in, but not
  decreased when logging out! Update: I was never, ever, able to replicate this...

* Some people reported a supposed memory leak inside qingy, but I was not
  able to reproduce the issue...




[GUI]

- drop down menu for sessions 

- Make applets possible... A mix of shared modules and window managing :P
  Maybe we could even port wmaker dockapps... just a dream of mine ;-)

- Make it possible to use e.g. mng files for animated images, for example for
  background and the like.

- make images scale according to virtualized / real resolution
  instead of always rendering them their actual size...

- Add a timeout (with fading) to the mouseover effect

- graphical configuration tool...

- Add support for a Win XP style login box...

- Add an option in theme file to select wether
  background image should be centered, scaled or tiled...

- Add support for multiline text labels...

- allow for linkings elements together, so that when you mouse over 
  one of them, all get the mouseover effect...
	window {
		id = pippo
		...
	}
	window {
		if = pluto
		mouseOver.linkTo = "pippo"
  }




[DOC]

- write a FAQ

- Update ALL documentation as it is severely outdated




[ENHANCEMENTS]

- Allow user to log into remote systems, also with xdmcp...

- Add support for wildcards in paths in config files...

* Make code compliant to the GNU Coding Standards.. That is to be done in order
  to try inclusion in the GNU Project.

- option for selecting session based on tty, not on user

- Add support for handling console bootsplash from inside qingy? That is: qingy
  background becomes framebuffer background when you log in...

- support some graphics toolkits other than DirectFB

- Add support for asking for a password after a given idle timeout.
  (note: look at 'who' source code to see how it gets idle times)

- Support for scripting things...

- support also the /dev/vc* in spite of /dev/tty*

- Add support for setting the LANG enviroment variable...

- Add an option to force user to select on a given list of allowed users on gived ttys...
  NOTE: this should way until we implement the mouse drop down list for comboboxes...

- Make qingy really start on one tty and fake its presence on the others...
  this would reduce memory usage, making it seem quicker at the same time.

- $$$ (huge but interesting blurb)

- Add drop down menu to chose between available X screen/resolutions...

$$$
when i log in as myself (non-root) with qingy, xinit seems to be run as root,
meaning that the system xinitrc file is used (eg. for XFCE /etc/xfce/xinitrc)
rather than the user xinitrc (eg. $HOME/.xfce4/xinitrc). i noticed this because
i use XFCE4 and changes to my xinitrc file were ignored by qingy but not when
starting xfce4 from console, instead qingy uses the /etc/ version, which is used
if $HOME/.xfce4/xinitrc can't be found (which implies that $HOME is not being
found under qingy) i know i can get round this by using the 'Your xsession'
option for logging in, but that means i have to manually set the window manager
etc in the .xsession file and cannot choose to use another one (i also use fluxbox)
via qingy if i want my $HOME session files to be used am i right in thinking that
qingy is executing xinit as root, and if so is this a bug or a feature?
how can i get qingy to use the logged-in-user's env for executing xinit etc?
