[FIXES]


TIMED RELOGIN
SUPPORT FOR CUSTOMIZING the "logging in..." and such like messages (in theme).



- Some command line options should migrate to config file...

- extend the --verbose option to virtually report all that can be reported ;-)




[GUI]

- Add a combo box to select between X server layouts.

- Make applets possible... A mix of shared modules and window managing :P
  Maybe we could even port wmaker dockapps... just a dream of mine ;-)

- Make it possible to use e.g. mng files for animated images, for example for
  background and the like.

- Add a timeout (with fading) to the mouseover effect

- graphical configuration tool...

- Add support for a Win XP style login box...

- Add an option in theme file to select wether
  background image should be centered, scaled or tiled...

- Add support for multiline text labels...

- allow for linkings elements together, so that when you mouse over 
  one of them, all get the mouseover effect...
	window {
		id = pippo
		...
	}
	window {
		id = pluto
		mouseOver.linkTo = "pippo"
  }




[DOC]

- Update ALL documentation as it is severely outdated




[ENHANCEMENTS]

- Allow user to log into remote systems, also with xdmcp...

- support some graphics toolkits other than DirectFB

- Support for scripting things...

- support also the /dev/vc* in spite of /dev/tty*

- Add support for setting the LANG enviroment variable...

- Add an option to force user to select on a given list of allowed users on given ttys...

- Make qingy really start on one tty and fake its presence on the others...
  this would reduce memory usage, making it seem quicker at the same time.

- $$$ (huge but interesting blurb)

- Add drop down menu to chose between available X screen/resolutions...

$$$
when i log in as myself (non-root) with qingy, xinit seems to be run as root,
meaning that the system xinitrc file is used (eg. for XFCE /etc/xfce/xinitrc)
rather than the user xinitrc (eg. $HOME/.xfce4/xinitrc). i noticed this because
i use XFCE4 and changes to my xinitrc file were ignored by qingy but not when
starting xfce4 from console, instead qingy uses the /etc/ version, which is used
if $HOME/.xfce4/xinitrc can't be found (which implies that $HOME is not being
found under qingy) i know i can get round this by using the 'Your xsession'
option for logging in, but that means i have to manually set the window manager
etc in the .xsession file and cannot choose to use another one (i also use fluxbox)
via qingy if i want my $HOME session files to be used am i right in thinking that
qingy is executing xinit as root, and if so is this a bug or a feature?
how can i get qingy to use the logged-in-user's env for executing xinit etc?
