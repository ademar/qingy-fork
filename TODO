- option for selecting session based on tty, not on user

- drop down menu for sessions 

* allow session locking 

- ldap support for authentication (with pam?)

- allow selection of alternate x server layouts / X config files

- Add an option to pass parameters to X server 

* Make key bindings customizable, add more actions available to keyboard
  shortcuts, like switch to the right workspace, or to the left, ot
  to the previous one...

* Make buttons use own pixmaps alpha channel for transparency instead of
  black...

- Make applets possible... A mix of shared modules and window managing :P
  Maybe we could even port wmaker dockapps... just a dream of mine ;-)

- Make it possible to use e.g. mng files for animated images, for example for
  background and the like.

* Make code compliant to the GNU Coding Standards.. That is to be done in order
  to try inclusion in the GNU Project.

- Make qingy install its stuff in a way that conforms to the file system
  hierarchy standards (much too much stuff in /etc ;-P right now)

- Add support for handling console bootsplash from inside qingy? That is: qingy
  background becomes framebuffer background when you log in...

- Implement the function behind the 'sleep' button (note: we should wait
  until my own powerd is done, so that we can tell it to activate sleep mode;
  I see no point in coding the same function twice).

- Some command line options should migrate to config file...

- Add support for wildcards in paths in config files...
