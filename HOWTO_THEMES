How To create your own themes for qingy version 0.2 series

Preamble:
For qingy, a theme is a subdirectory in /etc/qingy.
The name of this directory is the name of the theme.
You can select a theme by editing /etc/qingy/settings
and modifying line 'THEME default' with the name of the
theme you want to use (i.e.: 'THEME playboy').

What to put in the theme dir:
- A background image (filename:background.png).
- A font file supported by DirectFB. TTF fonts are OK.
- Two images for power button, one for it's normal appearance
  (filename:power_normal.png), one for when mouse passes over it
	(filename:power_mouseover.png).
- Two images for reset button, same rules as above
	(filenames:reset_normal.png,reset_mouseover.png).
- A config file (filename:theme). See below.

Writing a config file	for a theme:
One setting per line (i.e. 'FONT pippo.ttf'):
FONT <fontfilename>             font file to use
BUTTON_OPACITY <value>          opacity (transparency) of
                                power and reset buttons
					0 is totally transparent (invisible)
 					255 is totally opaque
WINDOW_OPACITY <value>          opacity of unselected fields
                                i.e. if you are modifying username,
				this applies for password, session and
				welcome to areas. Same values as above

SELECTED_WINDOW_OPACITY <value> opacity of active field
MASK_TEXT_COLOR <R> <G> <B> <A> Color of all text in main qingy window,
                                i.e. username, password, fields, etc etc;
						RGBA format (see below).
TEXT_CURSOR_COLOR <R> <G> <B> <A>   Color of the blinking cursor. Same
                                    rules as above.
OTHER_TEXT_COLOR <R> <G> <B> <A>    Color of text that is not in the main
                                    qingy window, i.e.: text of 'logging in',
                                    'shutting down', etc, etc messages. Same
																		rules as above.

RGBA colors:

Mix R (red), G (green) and B (blue) intensity values to
create all the colors of the spectrum.
